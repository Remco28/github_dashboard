## Summary
- implement the Recent Activity feed spec: fetch user events, render them with the new `ui/activity_feed` module, and surface the section above Project Tasks
- apply console-inspired styling refinements (light-mode palette, monospace font stack, link treatments) based on owner feedback
- update project spec and comms log to document the new behavior and approval status

## Testing
- `pytest`
