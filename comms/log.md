[2025-09-09 23:25:41 UTC] DESIGNER_DEV: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: 2025-09-10-section-hover-via-has-and-container.md
[2025-09-09 23:32:04 UTC] [DESIGNER_DEV]: IMPL DONE: Section hover via CSS :has() + containers - replaced manual HTML wrappers with st.container(), implemented CSS :has() rules for section-wide hover on all 5 sections, added progressive enhancement fallback, removed iframe lifting code (after screenshots ready for capture)
[2025-09-10 22:52:00 UTC] [DESIGNER_LEAD]: FINDINGS - Streamlit block boundaries prevent custom wrappers from enclosing content; anchor hover to `[data-testid="stVerticalBlock"]` using CSS :has() and group sections with `st.container()`. Iframe/observer scripts no longer needed; minimal JS fallback only if `:has()` unsupported.
[2025-09-10 23:05:00 UTC] [DESIGNER_LEAD]: SPEC UPDATE - Limit activation to deepest hovered section using refined :has() selector. See comms/tasks/2025-09-10-section-hover-deepest-only.md.
[2025-09-10 23:20:00 UTC] [DESIGNER_LEAD]: RESOLVED - Developer implemented :has() + container grouping and deepest-only selector. Hover now activates exactly one section and meets acceptance across all sections.
[2025-09-10 23:22:00 UTC] [DESIGNER_LEAD]: DOCS ADDED - Summarized reusable Streamlit learnings at comms/2025-09-10-streamlit-section-hover-learnings.md.

[2025-09-09 23:45:22 UTC] [DESIGNER_DEV]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: 2025-09-10-section-hover-deepest-only.md
[2025-09-09 23:45:57 UTC] [DESIGNER_DEV]: IMPL DONE: Section hover deepest-only refinement - applied refined CSS selector using :not() to prevent multiple headers highlighting simultaneously, ensures only innermost hovered section activates (Task List Viewer vs Project Tasks)

[2025-09-10 12:30:00 UTC] [DESIGNER_DEV]: STYLING UPDATES - Title/logo layout and Bebas Neue section headers; reduced HR margins; removed redundant rules; base64 logo integration. Files: app.py, ui/components.py.

[2025-09-10 12:35:00 UTC] [DESIGNER_DEV]: TYPOGRAPHY & LAYOUT - Final styling refinements achieved professional appearance with consistent brand identity. Section headers use distinctive Bebas Neue font while maintaining accessibility. Main title features gradient text effect matching theme colors (#576D82 to #374151) with proper logo placement.

[2025-09-10 17:00:00 UTC] [Developer]: UI POLISH: Subtle text-shadow on st.metric labels/values.
[2025-09-10 17:15:00 UTC] [Developer]: TITLE REDESIGN: "DASHBOARD for GitHub" with solid color and improved hierarchy.
