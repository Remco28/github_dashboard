[2025-09-09 23:25:41 UTC] DESIGNER_DEV: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: 2025-09-10-section-hover-via-has-and-container.md
[2025-09-09 23:32:04 UTC] DESIGNER_DEV: IMPL DONE: Section hover via CSS :has() + containers - replaced manual HTML wrappers with st.container(), implemented CSS :has() rules for section-wide hover on all 5 sections, added progressive enhancement fallback, removed iframe lifting code (after screenshots ready for capture)
[2025-09-10 22:52:00 UTC] DESIGNER_LEAD: FINDINGS - Streamlit block boundaries prevent custom wrappers from enclosing content; anchor hover to `[data-testid="stVerticalBlock"]` using CSS :has() and group sections with `st.container()`. Iframe/observer scripts no longer needed; minimal JS fallback only if `:has()` unsupported.
[2025-09-10 23:05:00 UTC] DESIGNER_LEAD: SPEC UPDATE - Limit activation to deepest hovered section using refined :has() selector. See comms/tasks/2025-09-10-section-hover-deepest-only.md.
[2025-09-10 23:20:00 UTC] DESIGNER_LEAD: RESOLVED - Developer implemented :has() + container grouping and deepest-only selector. Hover now activates exactly one section and meets acceptance across all sections.
[2025-09-10 23:22:00 UTC] DESIGNER_LEAD: DOCS ADDED - Summarized reusable Streamlit learnings at comms/2025-09-10-streamlit-section-hover-learnings.md.

[2025-09-09 23:45:22 UTC] DESIGNER_DEV: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: 2025-09-10-section-hover-deepest-only.md
[2025-09-09 23:45:57 UTC] DESIGNER_DEV: IMPL DONE: Section hover deepest-only refinement - applied refined CSS selector using :not() to prevent multiple headers highlighting simultaneously, ensures only innermost hovered section activates (Task List Viewer vs Project Tasks)

[2025-09-10 12:30:00 UTC] DESIGNER_DEV: STYLING UPDATES - Applied comprehensive visual enhancements:
- Changed app title from "GitHub Repository Dashboard" to "GITHUB DASHBOARD" (app.py:20, 175)
- Implemented Bebas Neue font for section headers with 1.5em size (ui/components.py:218-219)  
- Added custom title with gradient text effect and logo integration (app.py:184-198)
- Positioned logo below title with 0.4rem spacing for tight layout
- Reduced horizontal rule margins from default to 8px 0 4px 0 (ui/components.py:218)
- Removed unnecessary horizontal rules before "Repository Details" and missing NEXT_STEPS message
- Logo integration uses base64 encoding for seamless display (media/logo_trans_blue_med.png)

[2025-09-10 12:35:00 UTC] DESIGNER_DEV: TYPOGRAPHY & LAYOUT - Final styling refinements achieved professional appearance with consistent brand identity. Section headers use distinctive Bebas Neue font while maintaining accessibility. Main title features gradient text effect matching theme colors (#576D82 to #374151) with proper logo placement.
