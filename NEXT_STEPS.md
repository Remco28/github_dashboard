# NEXT STEPS – GitHub Project Tracker Dashboard

This repository’s working checklist for near-term improvements and polish.

## Filters & Time Window
- [ ] Support activity windows beyond 365 days (e.g., 730 days)
- [ ] Consider an "All time" option with clear rate-limit guidance

## Project Tasks (NEXT_STEPS)
- [x] Add a root-level NEXT_STEPS.md for dogfooding
- [x] Add “Repos without NEXT_STEPS.md” quick create guidance

## Rollout
- [ ] Add NEXT_STEPS.md files to other repos (Owner task)

Notes:
- Keep the file in the repository root so the app can fetch it via the GitHub Contents API.
- Use `- [ ]` and `- [x]` checkboxes under headings; the parser recognizes H1–H3 section headers.
