# 📊 GitHub Project Tracker Dashboard

A comprehensive Streamlit dashboard that provides insights into your GitHub repositories, including visualizations, activity tracking, and productivity features to help you stay motivated and organized.

## ✨ Features

- **Repository Overview**: Browse all your repositories with detailed stats and filtering options
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Language distribution, commit trends, activity heatmaps, and per-repository analytics
- **NEXT_STEPS Integration**: Parse and display NEXT_STEPS.md files from your repositories with task aggregation
- **Gamification**: Activity streaks, achievement badges, and progress tracking to stay motivated
- **Nudges & Insights**: Detect stale repositories and get gentle reminders to keep projects active
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent caching system to respect GitHub API rate limits
- **Per‑Section Refresh**: Refresh Visualizations, NEXT_STEPS, or Motivation independently without clearing the whole cache
- **Cache Telemetry**: Sidebar shows cache hits, misses, hit rate, and top cached functions (no PII)
- **Settings Help**: Built-in guidance for setup and troubleshooting

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd github_dashboard
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your GitHub credentials
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The dashboard will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# GitHub Configuration
# Create a personal access token with 'repo' scope to access private repositories
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username
```

### GitHub Token Setup

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes:
   - `public_repo` - For access to public repositories only
   - `repo` - For access to both public and private repositories (recommended)
4. Copy the generated token and add it to your `.env` file
5. Ensure your `.env` file is in `.gitignore` to keep your token secure

### Token Permissions

- **Public repositories only**: `public_repo` scope
- **All repositories (recommended)**: `repo` scope
- **Rate limits**: 5,000 requests/hour (authenticated), 60 requests/hour (unauthenticated)

## 🔧 Running the Application

Once configured, start the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will:
1. Load your GitHub configuration
2. Fetch repository data (cached for performance)
3. Display interactive dashboard with multiple sections:
   - Repository statistics and table
   - Visual analytics and charts
   - NEXT_STEPS task integration
   - Activity streaks and badges
   - Stale repository nudges

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
- Verify your `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid and not expired
- Check that token has appropriate scopes (`repo` or `public_repo`)
- Ensure `GITHUB_USERNAME` matches your GitHub username exactly

**Rate Limit Issues**
- Use the "Bypass Cache" checkbox sparingly
- Wait for rate limit reset (shown in error messages)
- Consider reducing the "Max Repositories for Charts" setting
- Use the cache controls to manage data freshness vs. API usage

**Empty Repository List**
- Check that your GitHub username is spelled correctly
- Verify your token has access to the repositories you expect
- Try the "Refresh" button to fetch fresh data
- Check the "Settings Help" panel in the sidebar for guidance

**Missing NEXT_STEPS Data**
- NEXT_STEPS.md files must be in the repository root
- Files are processed for the first 20 repositories only (for performance)
- Use repository filters to focus on specific projects

**Performance Issues**
- Reduce "Max Repositories for Charts" for faster loading
- Use cache controls to balance freshness vs. speed
- Filter repositories to focus on currently active projects

### Cache Controls

The dashboard includes intelligent caching to optimize performance:
- **Cache Stats**: View current cache status in the sidebar
- **Cache Telemetry**: See hits, misses, hit rate, and top cached functions for observability
- **Refresh Button**: Force refresh of repository list
- **Section Refresh**: Refresh just a section (Charts, NEXT_STEPS, Motivation) without clearing the cache
- **Bypass Cache**: Temporarily disable all caching (use sparingly)
- **Clear Cache**: Remove all cached data and start fresh
